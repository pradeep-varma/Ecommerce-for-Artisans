It’s not unusual to see a traffic jam on this road every mornings, as people come from near and far to eat breakfast here",

So, it’d be kind to pay them a bit more and see a happy face. ",

Rather, it is an extremely popular delicacy in a hill station close to the city called Araku. Araku Valley is a popular tourist destination because of its valleys and thick forests. The dish is prepared by stuffing marinated chicken inside the hollow of a bamboo stick. It is then cooked on coal for a delicious smokey flavor. On your way to Araku, you will come across several vendors on both sides of the road busy preparing this snack. While it is a bit pricy, meat-lovers are definitely going to love it.",
